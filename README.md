## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Public Radio is a single channel, single speaker FM receiver. 
As a piece of hardware, it was intended to be as simple as possible. One midrange speaker mounted inside a simple enclosure, with a single switched knob which controls power and adjusts volume.


## SYNOPSIS
The Public Radio is a project which spans industrial design, embedded systems design, and firmware. The files located within this project comprise a subset of the data reqired to fully complete ThePublic Radio, though efforts are being made to completely describe the project from top to bottom.

## CREDITS
The work herein is primarily a collaboration between Spencer Wright (http://pencerw.com) and Zach Dunham (http://zachdunham.com) though much of it was adapted heavily from friendly sources. In particular, early versions of the firmware was adapted directly from Nathan Seidle et al (Sparkfun). Special thanks also goes to Todd Bailey (http://blog.narrat1ve.com/) and Andy Warner (https://github.com/andyw-lala?tab=activity)

## CONTAINED HEREIN
A bunch of code. Honestly this repo is a bit out of date; we'll screw with it (in a good way!) more this winter/spring.

## ELSE
I'm new to this game. Holler at me if I'm missing something.
